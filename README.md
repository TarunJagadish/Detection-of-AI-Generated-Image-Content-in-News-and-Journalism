# Detection of AI-Generated Image Content in News

## Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting AI-generated image content in news articles, aiming to discern between images that are artificially generated and those that are authentic. This is important given the rise of synthetic media and deepfakes, which can distort public perception and trust in media.

The core methodology used in this project is a combination of computer vision techniques and machine learning models that were developed and tested on a dataset of both AI-generated and real images. The ultimate goal is to build a reliable classification system that can assist in the automated detection of AI-generated images within the context of journalism.

## Features

- Preprocessing pipeline for real and AI-generated images
- Model training and evaluation on multiple machine learning algorithms
- Detection model with performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Integration with image classification techniques to differentiate AI-generated content
- Code implementation in Jupyter Notebook format

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow/PyTorch
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Dataset

This project uses a curated dataset containing both real images and AI-generated images from different sources. Ensure that you have the dataset prepared and organized in the appropriate directories before running the notebook.

## How to  Run

- Clone the repository
- Navigate to the project directory
- Start Jupyter Notebook
- Open and run the notebook

## Model Architecture

The detection model is based on deep learning architectures such as CNNs, which are designed to extract features from image data and classify them as real or AI-generated. The model's performance has been evaluated using metrics like accuracy and loss to ensure its robustness and reliability.

## Results

The model achieved promising results on the dataset with high classification accuracy. Detailed performance metrics, as well as visualizations of the classification results, can be found in the Jupyter notebook.
